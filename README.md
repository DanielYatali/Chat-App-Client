myelinking was founded in 2022, by four individuals seeking to create a platform to overcome the communication 
boundaries for online university students. The platform allows students to openly communicate with each other 
based on similar interests and hobbies. Additionally, students are automatically placed within a faculty chat,
to get acclimated with the other students of their own faculty. The myelinking platform was designed with the 
intention of being sleek, modern, innovative and user-friendly.
